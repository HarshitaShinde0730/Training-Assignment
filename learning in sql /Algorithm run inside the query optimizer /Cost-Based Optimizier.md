## Cost Based Optimization: 
cost-based optimization (CBO) is an integral part of many modern SQL query optimizers, and it plays a key role in rule engines that evaluate and execute SQL queries. It enables services to create the most efficient execution plan for the SQL query.The cost-based optimizer uses metadata and statistics to estimate the amount of processing (memory, CPU, network traffic, and I/O) required for each operation. It compares the cost of alternative routes, and then selects the query-execution plan with the least cost.

COST-BASED OPTIMIZATION IS NOT AN ALGORITHM ITSELF BUT IT IS A FRAMEWORK WITHIN A SQL SERVER that LEVERAGES MULTIPLE ALGORITHMS, INCLUDING SEARCH, ESTIMATION, AND PRUNING TECHNIQUES.
